I am moving all the themes and plugin repositories to be under a new Github organization called [Octothemes](https://github.com/octothemes). [Brandon](https://github.com/imathis), the author of [Octopress](https://octopress.org) asked me to change it as the organization name caused people to assume it is an official Octopress project. We are not an official Octpress project, but a third party one. I think it is a reasonable request. So here we are on a new Github organization. To minimize disturbances to existing users, the old repositories will be preserved until the end of June. My sincere apologies for any disturbances caused.
